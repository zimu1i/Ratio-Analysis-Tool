# Stock Ratio Analysis Tool

A stock analysis app that evaluates companies using 12+ financial ratios across valuation, profitability, leverage, and liquidity. It gives you personalized recommendations based on your risk tolerance. 

#### Inspired by my coursework COMM101 (University of Waterloo)!

### **What It Does:**
This Streamlit app pulls real-time financial data from Yahoo Finance and calculates key financial ratios. It turns raw numbers into actual investment insights.

**Features:**
- Pulls live data for any publicly traded stock
- Adjusts analysis based on your investor profile (Conservative, Balanced, or Growth)
- Color-codes ratio interpretations so you can see what's good or bad at a glance
- Weights different ratios based on your risk tolerance
- Generates PDF reports you can save or share
